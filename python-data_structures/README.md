# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Task0 - Print a list of all integers

receive an array of integers. iterate through it and print it.

- printing must utilize "str.format"

- - that means it must look like `print("{:d}".format(index))`

it does **not** want the approach below.

`print(x.format)` is the same as `print(x)`, but it lets you alter the contents of x for the print.


```
{

x = "look at my beautiful {y}"

print ("x says" + x.format(y="content"))
}
```
