## Misc. notes

### [Aliasing by OpenBookProject](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch09.html#aliasing)

`is` is different from `==`

- `is` asks if they reference the same exact object, while `==` asks if the two are of equal value.

 - - an alias `is` the original.

- - - if you want to make a clone of a list, for example, clone it via b = a[:]
