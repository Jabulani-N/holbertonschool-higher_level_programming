A pyhton directory demonstrating class inheritance

## Task 0 - lookup

`dir(obj)` returns a list of all attributes and methods available to `obj`.

`list(stuff)` converts serially create items, such as from `x for x in range(y)` statements, into a list and returns the created list. if given a list, returns a copy of the same list given. `list(ex_list)` **does not** returns an alias of ex_list.

```

>>> list(x for x in range(4))

[0, 1, 2, 3]

>>>

```
## Task 1 - My list

`sorted(ex_list)` returns a list containing ex_list's elements, but sorted alphanumerically.
